# EchoJournal: Voice AI Journaling

Welcome! 

This is a fun project where I'm building **EchoJournal**, a **Voice AI Journaling** application. (The name is not finalized yetâ€”this baby still needs a name!) The goal is to create an interactive journaling experience using cutting-edge technologies.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: To be decided based on feasibility and user-experience

1. for backend I tried out Mozilla's DeepSpeech https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech - had version compatibility issue because it is no longer maintained and supported by later versions after python 3.7
2. https://github.com/flashlight/wav2letter


## Description

The application will allow users to journal using their voice, leveraging AI to enhance the experience. Stay tuned for updates as the project evolves!

## Status

Currently in the early stages of development.
